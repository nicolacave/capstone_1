# Housing and Accessibility in the United States
## Central Question
How does wheelchair accessibility in housing compare between the two most populated states in the United States?

## Data
https://data.world/crowdflower/housing-and-accessibility/workspace/project-summary?agentid=crowdflower&datasetid=housing-and-accessibility

10,104 rows, 22 columns
### Features
_unit_id, _golden,	_unit_state,	_trusted_judgments,	_last_judgment_at,	house_types,	house_types:confidence,	residential_yes,	residential_yes:confidence,	sidewalk_ok,	sidewalk_ok:confidence,	address	house_types_gold,	house_types_gold_reason,	lat,	long,	residential_yes_gold,	residential_yes_gold_reason,	sidewalk_ok_gold,	sidewalk_ok_gold_reason,	url

## Focus
Focusing in on four main features(address, geo-coordinates, sidewalk_ok, sidewalk_ok_gold_reason), I was able to look at how housing accessibile housing varied among states, after parsing the address column to extract states.

## Analysis
In my exploration of the data, several patterns became apparent: 
* accessible housing is most present urban areas
* differnce in proportion of accessible housing between NY and CA
## Further studies
Further studies:
Look at distance from major metropolitan center
Cross reference with state infrastructure annual budget
Compare across all states
